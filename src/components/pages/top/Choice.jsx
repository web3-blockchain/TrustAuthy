        Majority or minority? Which will win? <br />
        In this game, teams with fewer team members have an advantage because
        they have fewer "BAN points". <br />
        Players can also predict which team has more "BAN points" by watching
        the reactions on social media.
        <br />
        <br />
        The question is, will you buy NFTs of the team that seems to be winning?{' '}
        <br />
        Or of the team that’s losing?
        <br />
        <br />
        If the werewolves and the humans are in a close game, the team with more
        reactions on socials will win, and you will want to buy the NFT of that
        team.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, if you join that team 100 BAN points will be added to the
        team's count. In this way, the team that seems to be losing may have
        fewer team members and could come out as winners.
        <br />
        <br />
        Players need to think about which team they join, anticipating the
        actual number of team members.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition. <br />
        If both teams almost have the same number of people, the Vampires could
        “reverse WIN”. <br />
        If you want to win the big jackpot, join the Vampires!
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, which team will you choose?
